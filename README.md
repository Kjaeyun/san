# Sign Language Recognition and Translation 

This repository provides a pytorch-based implementation of Context Matters: Self-Attention forSign Language Recognition introduced by Fares et. al.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Updates

This repository is currently under construction!! 

### Prerequisites

Ofcourse, you need to have python, here we are using python 3.6. So you need to install python3.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Install Pytorch a very cool machine learning library and the CUDA environment. 

```
https://pytorch.org/
```

Install opencv2.
```
sudo apt-get install python-opencv
```

Other dependencies (numpy, etc..).
```
pip install numpy
```
